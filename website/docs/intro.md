# Getting Started

Let's discover **mockseries in less than 5 minutes** ðŸš€

## 1. Install mockseries

```shell
pip install mockseries
```

## 2. Create a timeseries generator

A timeseries can be expressed as a [combination of 3 components](https://otexts.com/fpp2/components.html): trend, seasonality and noise.  

The trend is the long term, average change of the timeseries, such as the increase in CO2 emissions.  
Seasonality is a cyclic pattern in the timeseries, such as the impact of the day-night cycle.  
Noise represents irregular and random changes of the timeseries.   

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from mockseries.trend import LinearTrend
from mockseries.seasonality import SinusoidalSeasonality
from mockseries.noise import RedNoise

trend = LinearTrend(coefficient=2, time_unit=timedelta(days=4), flat_base=100)
seasonality = SinusoidalSeasonality(amplitude=20, period=timedelta(days=7)) \
              + SinusoidalSeasonality(amplitude=4, period=timedelta(days=1))
noise = RedNoise(mean=0, std=3, correlation=0.5)

timeseries = trend + seasonality + noise
```  
Here, **2** seasonalities **with a different period** are combined. It's as easy as an addition !  
Many types of trends, seasonalities and noises are available.  
Just combine them with the operators **+**, **-** and **\***.  



## 3. Generate values 
Sample your timeseries on a timeframe.  
```python
from datetime import datetime
from mockseries.utils import datetime_range

time_points = datetime_range(
    granularity=timedelta(hours=1),
    start_time=datetime(2021, 5, 31),
    end_time=datetime(2021, 8, 30),
)
ts_values = timeseries.generate(time_points=time_points)
```
`datetime_range` helps you get the time points of a given granularity in a timeframe.  
For instance:  
timeframe of 1 hour, with a granularity of 1 **minute**: 60 points;  
timeframe of 1 hour, with a granularity of 1 **second**: 3600 points. 

## 4. Plot or write to csv 
```python
from mockseries.utils import plot_timeseries, write_csv

plot_timeseries(time_points, ts_values)
write_csv(time_points, ts_values, "hello_mockseries.csv")
```
You will get something like this:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}>

Now it's your turn !  
Go to the next page to explore interactions between components.  
Go directly to the [API Reference](./API%20Reference/mockseries/main) to checkout the available types of trends, seasonalities and noises.
